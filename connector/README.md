# connector
This is a spring cloud service connector that can be used to simplify service access for clients of the mssql-server-broker. 

For general information about service connectors, please refer to [this documentation.](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-spring-service-connector.html)

To use the connector, include it as a dependency for your project. See the [client-example](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/mssql-server-broker/tree/master/client-example) for guidance on how to do this.
